  MythTV provides a unified graphical interface for recording and viewing
  television programs. Refer to the mythtv package for more information.
  This package contains only the server software, which provides video
  and audio capture and encoding services. In order to be useful, it
  requires a mythtv-frontend installation, either on the same system or
  one reachable via the network.  A database is also required. The
  mythtv-database package must be installed, either on the same system,
  or one reachable via the network.  For a complete installation of all
  MythTV components, install the 'mythtv' package.
